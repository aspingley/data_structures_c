# data_structures_c
This repository contains assignments for the data structures course that I taught at IIIT Nagpur. All code is implemented in C programming language.

Each assignment comes with the solution file in C code and unit tests using Unity Testing Framework. The files checked into unity folder are not developed by me.

To cpmpile each assignment, type 'gcc unity.c unittestxxx.c solutionxxx.c' in terminal.
